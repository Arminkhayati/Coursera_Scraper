https://www.coursera.org/learn/brand,"Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour",331127,University of London & London Business School,6264,"Professor Nader Tavassoli of London Business School contrasts traditional approaches to branding - where brands are a visual identity and a promise to customers - to brands as a customer experience delivered by the entire organisation. The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals. The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along ""moments-that-matter"" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.

You will learn and practice the following skills:

1.	How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective 
2.	How to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) 
3.	How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies
4.	How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally
5.	How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. 

This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:

1.	Head. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today
2.	Heart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation
3.	Hands. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”"

The purpose of your final project is to give you a concrete artifact that you can use to demonstrate your mastery of new competencies and skills to either the executives in your current organization or to prospective employers."

https://www.coursera.org/learn/negociacao,Negociações de sucesso: estratégias e habilidades essenciais (em Português),75495,University of Michigan,1421,"Todos nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.Este curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. 

Cada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  
•	Quais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?
•	Que diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?
•	Qual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?
•	Quais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?
•	Quais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?
•	Quais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  

Durante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. 

Dependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que ""É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad"".

Após assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.

https://www.coursera.org/learn/estilos-liderazgo,Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos,35088,Universidad de los Andes,1616,"Liderazgo es una palabra que se usa para muchas cosas diferentes y a veces opuestas. Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución.En este curso vamos a preguntarnos ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?, ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.
 
Vamos a invitarte a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives, diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:

1. Tus propósitos
2. Los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar a ellos
3. Los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales
4. Los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean aliados o detractores
5. Tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos) que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente enfrentarás

Todo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando tus emociones, etc)
 
Vamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”;  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está pasando en tu interior?.
 
Estos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.
 
""Estilos de Liderazgo: Opciones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos"" (https://www.coursera.org/learn/estilos-liderazgo/home/welcome) es el primero de cuatro cursos que componen el programa especializado en ""Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI"" (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo-efectivo). Los otros tres cursos son: ""Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos""; ""Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje en Liderazgo""; y ""Liderazgo para el siglo XXI"". Puedes tomar todos los cursos por separado o sólo uno de ellos, sin embargo te recomendamos que te inscribas y participes en los cuatro, ojalá en el orden que te proponemos.

En general, todo el programa está dirigido a cualquier persona interesada en conectarse con sus propósitos y profundizar sus habilidades para progresar en desafíos personales y colectivos muy complejos. Es especialmente útil para personas en mandos medios y altos en organizaciones públicas, privadas y no gubernamentales (ONGs). También para líderes comunitarios, activistas y en general gente que trabaja con personas y que necesita desarrollar o profundizar habilidades y herramientas para crear, a partir de grupos con opiniones e intereses diversos comunidades que trabajan juntas para avanzar en los temas que les importan. Va a ser útil, también, para personas interesadas en aprender a mejorar los resultados que observan en su esfera de vida más personal."
https://www.coursera.org/learn/what-is-corruption-anti-corruption-compliance,What is Corruption: Anti-Corruption and Compliance,11270,University of Pennsylvania,425,"Have you ever paid someone for doing you a favor? You may be accustomed to tipping wait staff or other service providers, but what if you paid a police officer for NOT issuing a parking ticket?  Or if you gave a “gift” to a government official for signing a contract with your company? Tipping might be okay, but paying a bribe is a violation of the law.  
 Bribery is widespread and exists almost everywhere and in many forms.  Compliance programs address this and other forms of corruption. 
 
In this course we’ll discuss what corruption actually is by examining, for example, the difference between a tip and an illegal bribe.  We will examine where corruption exists, how it exists, its ramifications, and the genesis of today’s anti-corruption laws.  We’ll also focus on practical strategies for creating compliance policies and procedures that address and prevent corruption.

We will learn about the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and many other anti-corruption laws.  Much of the course will focus on building out compliance policies and procedures that address corruption.  We will also look at practical methods for preventing corruption in an organization as well as red flags and other mechanisms for identifying corruption early so that it can be adequately addressed."
