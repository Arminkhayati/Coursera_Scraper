https://www.coursera.org/specializations/wharton-success,Achieving Personal and Professional Success,35983,University of Pennsylvania,2225,"Based on four of the most popular courses taught at the Wharton School, Achieving Personal and Professional Success is designed to introduce the tools and techniques for defining and achieving success at home and at work. You'll learn how to find your passion and core values, how to apply these values to your own life, how to work well with others, how to communicate effectively, how to set goals, how to use influence to achieve these goals, and even how to say you are sorry. Through exercises, self-diagnostic surveys, quizzes, and many case studies, you'll discover how to define not only what you want, but also the best way to get it. While many business courses cover topics related to successful organizational practices, these courses provide key insights into successful personal practices, whether you are in the office or in your home. We all bring ourselves to work every day, and these courses will help you be your best self wherever you are."

https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment,452405,Indian School of Business,5689,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (“Dr. Happiness”),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why aren’t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could—or should—be
      - What are the “7 Deadly Happiness Sins” that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the “7 Habits of the Highly Happy” and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier."

https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindfulness,De-Mystifying Mindfulness,207029,Universiteit Leiden,1476,"Interest in meditation, mindfulness, and contemplation has grown exponentially in recent years.  Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.But, what actually is mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you mindful already, and how would you know?

Evolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed ‘meditation labs,’ in which you’ll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.

During the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.  And we gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by Mark Williams, co-developer of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Rebecca Crane, Director of the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at the University of Bangor. We have recently added expert advice from Dawn Scott (Spirit Rock & Barre Centre for Buddhist Studies), Sydney Spears (University of Kansa), Elisabeth Stanley (Georgetown University), Susan Woods (Centre for Mindfulness Studies), Patricia Rockman (University of Toronto) and Jeff Corntassel (University of Victoria).

""A deep and profound dive into the ethical, social, psychological, and philosophical implications of modern-day mindfulness practice. The course is not for the faint of heart, perhaps, but it is also full of practical, guided exercises for the uninitiated! Thank you for redefining my relationship to Mindfulness in a completely new and thought-provoking way"" 28 april 2021

""The course enabled me to explore the mindfulness construct at its deeper lever from philosophical, psychological and political lenses. The mindfulness labs were very useful in practicing the skills of being mindful."" 23 nov 2018

""i took this course after a period of time when I was trying to practice mindfulness and meditation, but with doubtful success. The course answered many questions to me, and I needed that to keep me motivated. It really helped me understand the origins and, more importantly, benefits of mindfulness practice and made me persist in my attempts. I'm really glad I took the course, I find it interesting, well taught and very useful for all those seeking deeper explanation in why trying mindfulness."" 9 Oct 2018

""I have taken other courses in other online platforms. However, this has been one of the best courses I have found online."" 3 Oct 2018

You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!

(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/

This course—which includes more than $1,000 of video and reading materials—offers some answers based on the latest research from social psychology. Students taking the course for a Certificate will also receive free membership in Social Psychology Network (SocialPsychology.org).COURSE DESCRIPTION FROM PROFESSOR PLOUS:

Each of us is dealt a different hand in life, but we all face similar questions when it comes to human behavior: What leads us to like one person and dislike another? How do conflicts and prejudices develop, and how can they be reduced? Can psychological research help protect the environment, and if so, how? This course offers a brief introduction to classic and contemporary social psychology, covering topics such as decision making, persuasion, group behavior, personal attraction, and factors that promote health and well-being.

Our focus will be on surprising, entertaining, and intriguing research findings that are easy to apply in daily life. The course will also draw from the websites of Social Psychology Network, the world's largest online community devoted to social psychology. I hope you'll join me for this course, have fun, and learn some useful information that enriches your life."
https://www.coursera.org/learn/happiness,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment,452405,Indian School of Business,5689,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of life’s biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (“Dr. Happiness”),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why aren’t the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they could—or should—be
      - What are the “7 Deadly Happiness Sins” that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the “7 Habits of the Highly Happy” and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier."
https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking,Introduction to Mathematical Thinking,414724,Stanford University,2451,"Learn how to think the way mathematicians do – a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking."

https://www.coursera.org/learn/negotiation-skills,Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills,1293483,University of Michigan,17473,"We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. I hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made “Successful Negotiation” one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, you’ll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation: 

   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy 

   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success 

   (3) Close: Create a Contract 

   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game 

To successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, you’ll need to do the following: 

(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that “It’s as good as Breaking Bad.” Another learner compared the course to “House of Cards.”  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!

(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ 

(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.

Este curso desarrolla y fortalece sus capacidades para formar, en la escuela, a ciudadanos que actúen de manera constructiva en una sociedad democrática, particularmente en tres ámbitos de la ciudadanía: la convivencia pacífica, la participación democrática y la valoración de las diferencias.Si está interesado en aportar a la construcción de una sociedad pacífica, democrática e incluyente a través de la educación, este es el lugar donde puede aprender herramientas pedagógicas primordiales para cumplir esa misión. Si bien el curso presenta ideas que pueden ser útiles para actores educativos en general, los ejemplos y estrategias están particularmente dirigidos a docentes de contextos escolares.

Teniendo en cuenta que formar para el ejercicio activo, crítico y constructivo de la ciudadanía es una necesidad prioritaria en los contextos actuales, el curso presenta los temas, asuntos, problemas y conceptos indispensables para promover el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanas de niños, niñas y jóvenes en formación. Para lograrlo se propone analizar la ciudadanía a través de la ampliación progresiva de sus contextos de aplicación: el individual, el interpersonal, el grupal, el comunitario y el mundial.

Adicionalmente a estas comprensiones conceptuales, el curso ofrece la oportunidad de desarrollar capacidades didácticas en los participantes, quienes podrán diseñar estrategias pedagógicas orientadas al desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas de sus educandos y a la construcción de ambientes democráticos de aprendizaje que favorezcan dicho desarrollo.

Las actividades propuestas en el curso están diseñadas de tal forma que los participantes puedan apropiarse de herramientas conceptuales y pedagógicas a partir del principio de “aprender haciendo”, en donde permanentemente estarán poniendo en práctica dichos aprendizajes. Este es un curso ampliamente flexible que permite a los participantes escoger diferentes rutas de aprendizaje para concentrarse en los contenidos de su interés y/o en el nivel de profundización que quieren alcanzar para cada uno de ellos. Es así como el curso permitirá, especialmente a docentes escolares, desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades que les permitan educar para la ciudadanía, formando ciudadanos activos y críticos, que respeten la diferencia, que conozcan y hagan uso de los mecanismos de participación para la transformación de sus comunidades y que resuelvan pacífica y constructivamente los conflictos y retos que les plantea la sociedad en su rol como ciudadanos de su vida, de su comunidad y del mundo.

El diseño de este curso fue realizado en el marco de la segunda fase del SREDECC (Sistema Regional de Evaluación y Desarrollo de Competencias Ciudadanas), un escenario latinoamericano de cooperación técnica, financiado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y operado por la Fundación Antonio Restrepo Barco.  En su segunda fase fue liderado por los Ministerios de Educación de Costa Rica, Colombia y México."

El Programa especializado en “Liderazgo Efectivo para el Siglo XXI”, es el primer programa especializado en línea, abierto y masivo que se produce desde el Centro de Liderazgo Público (CLP) de la Escuela de Gobierno Alberto Lleras Camargo de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia. El CLP tiene como misión crear conocimiento y capacidad de liderazgo para ayudar a que progresemos en los temas complejos que más nos importan en el mundo actual. 

El programa fue diseñado por Maite Careaga Tagüeña, PhD y Héctor Fabio Hernández, MPP, con el apoyo de Saluma Castillo y el equipo Conecta-TE de la Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, y está inspirado en los cursos y talleres  de liderazgo que Maite lleva 15 años diseñando y facilitando  (los primeros los diseñó junto con Felipe Bozzo y Sebastián Quirmbach en Leaderbuilding) y en las lecciones aprendidas  al investigar cómo diseñar y evaluar estrategias pedagógicas para enseñar habilidades personales y sociales para el liderazgo.

Este curso ha sido diseñado como el cuarto y último del programa especializado (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/liderazgo), el cual te permitirá adueñarte de una metodología de intervención, que llamamos espiral de liderazgo consciente, y desarrollar y aplicar una caja de herramientas para movilizar personas (a sí mismo y a otros) a trabajar en solucionar los desafíos complejos que las afectan e importan. Los otros tres cursos del programa son: ""Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos"", ""Autoliderazgo y Gestión de Emociones para Avanzar en Desafíos Complejos"" y ""Comunicación, Experimentación y Aprendizaje en Liderazgo"". Puedes tomar todos los cursos por separado o sólo uno de ellos, sin embargo te recomendamos que te inscribas y participes en los cuatro, ojalá en el orden que te proponemos."
